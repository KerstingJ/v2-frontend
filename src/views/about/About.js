            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              I am a Software Engineer, and Father. Born in Muskegon, Mi, I
              spent most of my professional life traveling the Mid-South and
              Mid-west helping grass-roots organizations manage and use data to
              drive organizational goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              After moving back home to be closer to family I joined Lambda
              School, where I not only completed their curriculum in Computer
              Science and Web Development in 2019, but was also a Team Lead
              mentoring and teaching students working their way through the
              curriculum.
            </p>
            <p>
              In October I joined SampleServe as a Frontend Engineer. I develop
              React and React Native applications and work with clients to
              identify problems and plan features. I championed code quality by
              adding testing and modularization to increase confidence in every
              push.

              We are what we believe. These are the beliefs that form the core
              of who I am.

              <strong>People are kind </strong>
              Looking at the news, and media, we love to have a bad guy. We love
              heros more, but how does a hero exist without a villain? I believe
              they exist in everyday acts of kindness. When I look at my sons
              chocolate covered face, as he gestures his dirty little fingers to
              share candy with his cousin, I see the one thing I know to be true
              about the world. People are kind and act with the best intentions
              they know how.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Together we are more </strong>
              As much as one person can do by themselves, a group can do so much
              more. There is so much to learn and do in the world oen person
              couldn't do it all. Luckily we get to share the experiences of
              others through writings, art, music, and creating things together.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Never stop moving </strong>
              Sometimes we need to take a step back and look how far we've come,
              but I cant do that without seeing all the people who have helped
              me along the way. For the people who believed in me when I didn't
              believe in myself, I will never give up, I will never stop
              learning, I will never stop moving forward.
